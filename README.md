# Mettrr Backend Tech Test - The Debt Tracker

Welcome to the Mettrr backend tech test!

## Installation and setup

Please spend no more than 4 hours on this test. If you have some spare time
have a go at the bonus question at the bottom. Don't worry if you don't have a
complete solution by the end, feel free to submit in English how you would go
about finishing the rest of the test and / or bonus question. You may do this
test in whatever language you feel comfortable with, ideally with a test suite
in place using a testing framework of your choosing.

You don't need to implement any front end interface but please provide
instructions in a readme on how to interact with your program.

Feel free to use whatever third party packages or dependencies you think may
help to simplify this test but please be prepared to justify your decision to
use them.

Please start by cloning or forking the repo to your personal GitHub account,
renaming the repo to something random of your choosing. See
[here](https://www.michaelfogleman.com/phrases/) for inspiration.

Once you are done, push your changes and send an email with a link to your
solution to myself (address below) to confirm completion.

If at any stage you have any questions, please contact Dom at
[db@mettrr.com](mailto:db@mettrr.com).

Good luck!

## The Test

Your goal is to create a program which can track debts between people. The
program should allow the ability to add a debt between two or more people and
be able to view for a given person how much they owe and are owed and to whom.
You may add any other features you think might benefit the program.

## Bonus Question

Consider the following scenario:

Alex owes Bea £10 and Bea owes Clare £10. In order to settle their debts,
instead of Alex having to pay Bea and Bea having to pay Clare, Alex can simply
pay Clare £10.

Add a feature to your program which can calculate the simplest way to settle
debts between multiple people.
