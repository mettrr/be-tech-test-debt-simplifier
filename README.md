# Mettrr Backend Tech Test - The Debt Simplifier

Welcome to the Mettrr backend tech test!

## Installation and setup

This test should take roughly one or two hours. Don't worry if you don't have a
complete solution by that time, feel free to submit in English how you would go
about finishing the rest of the test. You may do this test in whatever language
you feel comfortable with, ideally with a test suite in place using a testing
framework of your choosing.

Please start by creating a branch from master with the naming convention -
"{your name}/mettrr-tech-test".

## The Test

Consider the following scenario:

Alex owes Bea £10 and Bea owes Clare £10. In order to settle their debts,
instead of Alex having to pay Bea and Bea having to pay Clare, Alex can simply
pay Clare £10.

Your goal is write a program that can track debts between people and offer a
way to settle the debts in the simplest way possible.

Feel free to use whatever third party packages or dependencies you think may
help to simplify this test but please be prepared to justify your decision to
use them.

If at any stage you have any questions, please contact Dom at db@mettrr.com.

Once you are done, push your changes to your branch and create a pull
request to master, tagging @dbatten5 in it and followed by an email to myself
(address above) to confirm your completion. Good luck!
